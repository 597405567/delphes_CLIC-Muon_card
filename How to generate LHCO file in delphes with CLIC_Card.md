# How to generate LHCO file in delphes with CLIC_Card

When using ma5 for reconstructed-level analysis, the program generally uses the LHCO file as input. 
To get the LHCO file, we need to use the root2lhco that comes with delphes to convert the root file generated by delphes into an LHCO file. 
If you use CLIC and the delphes card of the muon collider, you will find that the program will prompt an error and warning when you convert the root to the lhco file:
///////////////////////
** WARNING: cannot access branch 'Jet', return NULL pointer
** ERROR: ROOT file doesn't contain all required branches
///////////////////////
At this time, the LHCO file was not successfully generated. 
The reason is: before the root2lhco command generates the LHCO file, it will first determine whether the branch in the root file contains the following branches:
///////////////////////
if(!fBranchEvent || !fBranchTrack || !fBranchTower || !fBranchPhoton || !fBranchElectron || !fBranchMuon || !fBranchJet || !fBranchMissingET)
   {
     throw runtime_error("ROOT file doesn't contain all required branches");
   }
///////////////////////
Combined with the error report, we can know that the root file generated by delphes_card such as CLIC or muon does not contain fBranchjet, 
so the code will not continue run, and the LHCO file will not be successfully generated.
Here we offer a workaround and another way of thinking about the problem:
Solution:
After browsing and comparing a large number of delphes cards, we found that the CLIC or Muon cards use fastjetfinderkt to identify jets, 
and other cards use fastjetfinder to identify jets. 
When outputting jets recognized by fastjetfinderkt, these jets are generally named ktjets, and 
when outputting jets recognized by fastjetfinder, they are generally named Jet. 
This difference is what causes the error.
Here we suggest changing the ktjets output by fastjetfinderkt to Jet.
Below the root tree writer in correspnding CLIC_card or Muon_card there is a command like this:
///////////////////////
add Branch FastJetFinderKt/KTjets KTjet Jet
///////////////////////
We need to modify this line of command to: 
///////////////////////
add Branch FastJetFinderKt/KTjets Jet Jet
///////////////////////
After doing this, the root file can be successfully converted into an LHCO file.
It is necessary to declare here: 
we only modified the variable name of the output, and did not modify the default jet recognition algorithm of CLIC.
